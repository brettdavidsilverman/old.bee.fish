TO DO
Todo:

Authentication-app for logging in, parsers the input file a second time. When we "register" apps, could we also register the variables the app needs to capture. This  way we only need to  parse once for the basics like file-app and authentication-app

Index:
  
   type -> id -> property -> value
   type -> property -> value -> id
   
   id->property->value
   property->value->id
   
   value: Number, String, Date, Pointer
   id: Id
   property: String
