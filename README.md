# bee.fish
Files to create bee.fish website

This contains all the files used to research and design https://bee.fish

The files under /server are used to create an actual https server.
Use the make command to build the C++ programs.

The rest of the files are html or js and provide examples of what I've been researching.
The /client directory has the layers needed to create the /client/draw app.

The /server/database directory has files needed to create a bit hierarchical database.
Currently the draw program uses it as key/value pair database.
